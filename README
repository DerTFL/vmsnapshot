vmsnapshot is a script to snapshot all of the running libvirt virtual machines running on a server. It optionaly saves
their state as well. If the machine state is saved, it's like putting your VM's into hibernate, then restoring them.


Requirements:

Besides a basic Ubuntu Linux install, you're need these packages

lzop
mailutils
virsh
libvirt-bin

You'll need to be running virtual machines via libvirt and have them stored on LVM volumes


Usage:

1. Edit vmhostsnapshot and set "$email" to your email address
2. Set "$saveState" to enabled or disabled depending on your preference
3. Set "$nfsDest" to a path (nfs or not), and create subdirectories for each VM, and one called "vmstate"
   e.g. /backups/host1, /backups/mailserver, /backups/vmstate
2. Run ./vmhostsnapshot
